      "💡 Answer:\n",
      "Based on the provided context, the difference between machine learning and deep learning is that machine learning is a broader subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience, whereas deep learning is a subset of machine learning that specifically uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data.\n",
      "\n",

      "💡 Answer:\n",
      "To reduce hallucinations in language models, you can use the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach, which combines information retrieval with text generation. This approach retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and uses them as context for generating accurate, grounded responses, thereby reducing hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",

      "💡 Answer:\n",
      "Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP). They are important because they use self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data in parallel, making them more efficient than previous architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This allows for significant advancements in tasks such as language understanding and generation, as seen in models like GPT and BERT.\n",
